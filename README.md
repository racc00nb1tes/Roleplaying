# Roleplaying
I'm a minor, but I don't mind roleplaying with adults as long as you aren't creepy about it. I'm usually in the Undertale area or the Dream SMP area, and these are the only two fandoms I roleplay for at the moment. This will most likely change in the future.

Characters I usually roleplay as for Undertale are Papyrus, Alphys, Napstablook, and Frisk. The other characters I have made for Undertale are Chara, Sans, Grillby, Mad Mew Mew, Temmie, Toriel, and Undyne.

Characters I usually roleplay as for Dream SMP are c!Charlie and c!Tommy. The other characters I have made for Dream SMP are c!Quackity, c!Niki, c!Purpled, and c!Hannah.

I can roleplay as another character then the ones I frequent, but I most likely won't be as good at it.

When roleplaying, I use "quotations" for speech, *asterisks* for actions, and (parentheses) for Out Of Character thoughts or speech. I use the /think for In Character thoughts. Messages in /think are not messages you're supposed to respond to. I do not follow these rules when I'm not roleplaying!

When it comes to ships, my favorites to roleplay are Alphys X Undyne, Papyrus X Mettaton, Grillby X Sans, c!Quackity X c!Charlie, and c!Tommy X c!Purpled. If you want to roleplay another ship, just ask!

I don't want to roleplay any ships that are Minor X Adult or Incestual.

I do not have a DNI! Personally, I find them a bit silly, because people can literally just lie. However, if you make me uncomfortable, I will block you. I usually will tell people that they're making me uncomfortable just in case they're willing to correct their behavior, but if they don't they get blocked.

I will also roleplay on Discord! My Discord username is raccoonb1tes. (including the period!)
